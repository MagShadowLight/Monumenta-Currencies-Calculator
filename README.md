# Monumenta-Currencies-Calculator

this is the Monumenta Currency Calculator

first time adding it to github

give me some feedback
and let me know about how do you open the console on Mac and Linux because I don't have those two

Edit #1: I have updated this project to add a function to have history and recalculate from history, but a WARNING to you all: Please don't use it yet otherwise it will crash. It has a known bug that cause the whole app to crash (if you think I'm kidding about the warning, go ahead and try it yourself to see :suffer:)
